I was the lead engineer for this project with Konica Minolta that wanted a vulnerability assessment on their World Wide Remote Service Platform.
The tools that were utilized:
nmap
OWASP ZAP
Burpsuite
Nikto
Legion
Crawljax/Ajax Spider
Dirbuster
Medusa
Hydra
Legion

Multi-function Printers (MFPs) allow businesses to print, copy, scan, fax and more. Before, these devices required on-site maintenance, but now customers benefit from, remote services that eliminate travel, cost and downtime. Konica Minolta uses an automated, cloud-based monitoring and device reporting service – World Wide Remote Service Platform (WWRSPF)  – for management. By participating in Miercom’s Certified Secure program, its products were subjected to vulnerability testing in a real-world environment to analyze functionality and identify any possible ingresses for attack. We found Konica Minolta to have sophisticated security against complex tests, no vulnerable ports or servers, and protection against attacks such as IPsec spoofing and brute force.
